                                             BV MICHAEL C, CLINE,      t-I - LOS ALAMUS SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY



               PROGRAM ABSTRACT -

                                THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR TMO-OIMEN3IONAL, TIME DEPENDENT, INVISCID FLOM IN A NOZZLE
                           ARE SOLVED USING THE SECOND-ORDER, MACCORMACK, FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEME, THE FLUID IS ASSUMED
                           TO BE A PERFECT GAS. ALL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE COMPUTED USING A SECOND-ORDER, REFERENCE PLANE
                           CHARACTERISTIC SCHEME, THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION IS OBTAINED AS THE ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTION FOR
                           LARGE TIME, THE NUZZLES MAY BE EITHER CONVERGING, CONVERGING-DIVERGING, OH PLUG GEOMETRIES,
