# Figure 10 Extraction Notes

Source: `docs/references/NAP - Two Dimensional Invisid Flow.pdf`

Identified Figure 10 page range for Case No. 2 output:
- Page 30: title/program abstract/control-parameter print
- Page 31: geometry print and run progression (`N=10...250`)
- Pages 32--34: solution-surface table (No. 250) and summary

Raw extracted text files:
- `fig10_p30.txt`
- `fig10_p31.txt`
- `fig10_p32.txt`
- `fig10_p33.txt`
- `fig10_p34.txt`

Structured table artifact:
- `fig10_surface250_longtable.tex` (OCR-normalized full 23 x 7 grid)
- Current row coverage: 161/161 expected rows (23 x 7 grid)
- A subset of rows required OCR interpretation where the scan was degraded; raw extracts are retained for auditability.
