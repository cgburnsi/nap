                                     BY MICHAEL C. CLINE, T-3 - LOS ALAMOS SCIENTIFIC LABORATORY



      PROGRAM ABSTRACT -

                     THE EQUATIONS OF MOTION FOR TWO-DIMENSIONAL, TIME DEPENDENT, INVISCID FLOW IN A NOZZLE
                ARE SOLVED USING THE SECOND-ORDER, MACCORMACK, FINITE-DIFFERENCE SCHEME, THE FLUID IS ASSUMED
                TO BE A PERFECT GAS, ALL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS ARE COMPUTED USING A SECOND-ORDER, REFERENCE PLANE
                CHARACTERISTIC SCHEME, THE STEADY STATE SOLUTION IS OBTAINED AS THE ASYMPTOTIC SOLUTION FOR
                LARGE TIME, THE NOZZLES MAY BE EITHER CONVERGING, CONVERGING-DIVERGING, OR PLUG GEOMETRIES,
