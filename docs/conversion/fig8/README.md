# Figure 8 Extraction Notes

Source: `docs/references/NAP - Two Dimensional Invisid Flow.pdf`

Identified Figure 8 page range for Case No. 1 output:
- Page 22: title/program abstract/control-parameter print + `N=10...130`
- Page 23: run progression continuation (`N=140...300`)
- Page 24: solution-surface table (No. 301, first block)
- Page 25: solution-surface table continuation
- Page 26: solution-surface table continuation
- Page 27: solution-surface table completion + mass/thrust summary

Raw extracted text files:
- `fig8_p22.txt`
- `fig8_p23.txt`
- `fig8_p24.txt`
- `fig8_p25.txt`
- `fig8_p26.txt`
- `fig8_p27.txt`

Structured table artifact:
- `fig8_surface301_longtable.tex` (OCR-normalized full 21 x 8 grid)
- Current row coverage: 168/168 expected rows (21 x 8 grid)
- A subset of rows required OCR interpretation where the scan was degraded; raw extracts are retained for auditability.
