A computer program, NAP, is presented for calculating inviscid, steady, and unsteady flow in two-dimensional and axisymmetric nozzles. Interior mesh points are computed using the MacCormack finite-difference scheme, while a characteristic scheme is used to calculate the boundary mesh points. An explicit artificial viscosity term is included for shock computations. The fluid is assumed to be a perfect gas. This method was used to compute the steady flow in a $45^{\circ}$-$15^{\circ}$ conical, converging-diverging nozzle, a $15^{\circ}$ conical, converging nozzle, and a $10^{\circ}$ conical, plug nozzle. The numerical solution agreed well with the experimental data. In contrast to previous time-dependent methods for calculating steady flows, the computational times were $< 1$ min on a CDC 6600 computer.
