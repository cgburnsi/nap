# Implementation Roadmap

## Milestones
1. Establish stable orchestration skeleton (config -> grid -> state -> solver -> verifier -> plots).
2. Rebuild baseline grid/geometry and 1D initialization path.
3. Restore transient marching and boundary treatment.
4. Reproduce baseline reference metrics and plots.
5. Refactor internals while holding parity.

## Current Focus
- Keep geometry+grid coupled until baseline parity is stable.
