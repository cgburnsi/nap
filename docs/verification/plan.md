# Verification Plan

## Required Checks
- Grid sanity: dimensions, throat index/location.
- Initialization sanity: inlet/throat/exit Mach behavior.
- March sanity: residual trend and convergence status.
- Reference check: comparison against published/table data when available.

## Pass/Fail Gate
A change is acceptable only if baseline behavior is preserved or deviations are explicitly documented.
