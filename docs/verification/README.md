# Verification Assets

Use this folder for source-of-truth verification inputs and notes.

## Folder layout
- `baselines/` - checked-in reference files used for verification
- `../..//artifacts/verification/` - generated outputs from current runs

## What goes in `baselines/`
- Reference screenshots/plots from original NAP sources
- Reference CSV tables used for numeric comparison
- Any small hand-curated notes needed to interpret the references

Suggested filenames:
- `baselines/cd_nozzle_wall_from_scan.png`
- `baselines/cd_nozzle_mach_pressure_reference.png`
- `baselines/cd_nozzle_converged_solution.csv`

## What goes in `artifacts/verification/`
